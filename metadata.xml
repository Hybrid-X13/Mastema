    <description>[b]In the Book of Jubilees, Mastema was a fallen angel who carried out punishments, tempted humans, and tested their faith, all under God’s permission. Now, he’s made his way to the basement for you to play as![/b]

[h1][b]Mastema[/b][/h1]
As Mastema, your life always hangs in the balance. Treasure rooms, shops, devil and angel rooms, they all contain items that must be paid for with hp. Will you resist temptation to save your hp for better items in the future, or will you give in and risk losing it all?

Mastema starts with a few tools of the trade. All typical item rooms will instead be red treasure rooms, always containing an additional blind item even when you're not on the alt path. Duality allows you to choose between devil or angel rooms right from the start, with each room having an additional benefit. But the most important tool in Mastema's kit is a pocket Prayer Card, his saving grace for gaining more hp and becoming more powerful.

[h1][b]Tainted Mastema[/b][/h1]
Mastema’s soul is now fully consumed by temptation. He no longer performs his duties under God and instead pledged his new faith to the devil, and in return, restored Mastema’s torn wings and gave him newfound power, with a catch of course...

Instead of paying for items with his heart containers, Tainted Mastema gains broken hearts when he picks up an item. This might seem drastic, but he has additional ways of removing broken hearts besides Confessionals. Using the spikes in sacrifice rooms or the spikes from Sanguine Bond have a chance of removing broken hearts. With a higher chance of finding soul hearts plus a pocket Satanic Bible, Tainted Mastema's health is always on the edge.
